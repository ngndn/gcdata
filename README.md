##Introduction
This is the code for transforming the original "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set" into the desire format required by the project in Getting and Cleaing Data - Coursera

The dataset can be found at:
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

The code is one R script "run_analysis.R".

##How to run the script
By default, the working directory of the script is the folder "UCI HAR Dataset". Running the script within that working directory in R using `source()` command will provide a file called "new_data.txt". This is the dataset the course require to produce.

If "UCI HAR Dataset" is not a working directory. Please specify the path to the folder by modifying the`path` variable in the script.
